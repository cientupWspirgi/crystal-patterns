## What is a Crack Fix?
 
A crack fix is a file or a program that modifies or bypasses the copy protection of a game. Some games require a valid CD or DVD to run, or an online activation or verification. A crack fix can allow players to play the game without these requirements, or to use features that are otherwise locked or restricted. However, using a crack fix may also cause some problems, such as compatibility issues, performance issues, or security risks. Therefore, we do not recommend using a crack fix unless you have a legitimate copy of the game and you have exhausted all other solutions.
